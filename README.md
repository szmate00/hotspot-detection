# Hotspot detection
Algorithms to detect plasma-wall interactions (hotspots) in the images taken by the EDICAM camera system inside the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator

## Local hotspot detection
Detecting hotspots in predefined regions of interests (ROIs)<br>
[See code here](https://github.com/szmate00/hotspot_detection/blob/master/local_detection/hotspot_detect_roi.py)
## Universal hotspot detection
Under development...
